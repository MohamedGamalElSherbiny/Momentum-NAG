# Linear Descent Machine Learning Project:

## Full implementation of the mean square error gradient descent

* Batch Gradient Descent

  * Adding the Momentum Implementation
    
  * Adding the Momentum and NAG Implementations
    

* Mini Batch Gradient Descent
  

* Stochastic Gradient Descent

* Adding the charts for each implementation

* Printing the Accuracy of each system using the r2_score

## This project uses each of: 
* Numpy Library

* Matplotlib.pyplot Library

* R2_score from Sklearn.Metrics Library
